Programming guide:
- Try to plan as much out as possible ahead of time
- Take breaks every hour or so (important!)
- 





We're going to:

//- check if we can make a room
//- make a room
//- turn the spot where this door is into GROUND
//- randomly turn either one or both walls adjacent to this door into GROUND //  (shouldn't conflict w/ walls w/ multiple possible doors)
// - swap rdi with possibleDoors.length-1, then pop() to delete it
- create as many possble doors as you can along each wall of this new room. each of these new possible door MUST have both adjacent walls NOT be corners and leave a wall between another door on the same wall.
